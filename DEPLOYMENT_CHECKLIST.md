## Production Environment Variables

### Required Variables

```bash
VITE_BASE44_SERVER_URL=https://base44.app
VITE_BASE44_APP_ID=your_production_app_id
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
```

### Optional Variables

```bash
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=true
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
VITE_ANALYTICS_ID=your_analytics_id
```

## Deployment Commands

### Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Production deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
# Check status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
```

### Using Deployment Script

```bash
# Deploy new version
./deploy.sh deploy
# Check status
./deploy.sh status
# View logs
./deploy.sh logs
# Rollback if needed
./deploy.sh rollback
```

### Manual Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t mediflow:latest .
# Run container
docker run -d \
  --name mediflow-prod \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e VITE_BASE44_SERVER_URL=https://base44.app \
  -e VITE_BASE44_APP_ID=your_app_id \
  -e VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false \
  mediflow:latest
```

## Health Check Endpoints

- **Application Health**: `http://yourdomain.com/health`
- **Docker Health**: `docker ps` (check container status)
- **Nginx Status**: `curl -I http://yourdomain.com`

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Application uptime
- Response times
- Error rates
- Memory usage
- CPU usage
- Disk space

### Alert Thresholds

- Uptime: < 99.9%
- Response time: > 2 seconds
- Error rate: > 1%
- Memory usage: > 80%
- CPU usage: > 80%
- Disk space: > 85%

## Rollback Procedure

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Using deployment script
./deploy.sh rollback
# Using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.backup.yml up -d
```

### Manual Rollback

1. Stop current container
2. Load previous image
3. Start previous container
4. Verify functionality
5. Investigate issue

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediate (0-1 hour)

- [ ] Verify application is accessible
- [ ] Check all critical features
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Verify monitoring is working

### Short-term (1-24 hours)

- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Check user feedback
- [ ] Verify all integrations
- [ ] Update documentation if needed

### Long-term (1-7 days)

- [ ] Analyze performance data
- [ ] Review error patterns
- [ ] Optimize based on usage
- [ ] Plan next iteration

docker logs mediflow-prod
# Check Nginx configuration
docker exec mediflow-prod nginx -t
# Test connectivity
curl -I http://yourdomain.com
```
