# Dynamic Import Error Fix - Patients Page

## 🐛 **Issue Resolved**

**Error**: `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:5173/src/pages/Patients.tsx`

**Root Cause**: Missing React import in the Patients.tsx file causing JSX compilation errors.

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

### Problem
The `src/pages/Patients.tsx` file was missing the React import, which caused:
- JSX compilation errors
- Dynamic import failures
- Module loading issues in the browser

### Solution
Added the proper React import to the Patients.tsx file:

```typescript
// Before (causing errors)
import { useState, useMemo, useEffect } from "react";

// After (fixed)
import * as React from "react";
import { useState, useMemo, useEffect } from "react";
```

## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### Build Test
```bash
npm run build
# ✅ SUCCESS - Build completed without errors
```

### Runtime Test
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5173/patients
# ✅ SUCCESS - Returns 200 status code
```

## 📊 **Impact**

- **Dynamic imports now work** for the Patients page
- **JSX compilation errors resolved**
- **Module loading successful** in the browser
- **Patients page accessible** at `/patients` route

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

The issue was caused by:
1. Missing React import in Patients.tsx
2. TypeScript/JSX compiler unable to process JSX without React in scope
3. Dynamic import failing due to compilation errors

The fix ensures:
1. React is properly imported and available for JSX
2. TypeScript compiler can process the file correctly
3. Dynamic imports work as expected
4. The Patients page loads successfully

## ✅ **Status: RESOLVED**

The Patients page dynamic import error has been successfully fixed and the page is now accessible.
